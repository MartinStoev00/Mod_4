Installation:
1. Import 'caren' as a maven project in eclipse.
2. Right click the project -> Maven -> Update Project.
3. Right click the project -> Properties -> Deployement Assembly -> Add -> Java Build Path Entries -> Maven Dependencies -> Apply and Close.
4. Create an Apache Tomcat Server for it.
5. Add caren as a resource to the server.
6. Run the server.
7. Go to localhost:8080/caren/
8. You can choose to create an account or login.

Since creating a new account will mean you will have 0 records and associaitons, it is better to login in with one of the following accounts.
You can login as the following accounts:
Client: Email: Okey.Batz@nedap.nl -- Password: 123.
Client: Email: Augusta.OReilly@nedap.nl -- Password: 123.
Care provider: Email: I.K.H.Ebnekpijn@nedap.nl -- Password: 123.

Note: All of the three accounts are related either by care providing or care giving and so each other's records can be seen.
